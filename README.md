# 🎡 Site Spinner

> Spin any web app like a canvas!  
> **Site Spinner** lets you load websites inside an iframe and freely rotate or resize them — perfect for adding a missing rotation feature to your own web creations.


## 🌐 What It Does

- Load any website URL  
- Rotate the page freely by dragging the handle  
- Snap automatically to 0°, ±90°, ±180°  
- Resize the viewing frame (width & height)  
- Reset angle anytime  
- Works beautifully with drawing apps like **[rakugaki_pao](https://kurajo.ivory.ne.jp/rakugaki_pao)** ✏️  


## 💡 Example Use

Want to rotate your drawing canvas but your app doesn’t support it?  
Just open it inside **Site Spinner** and spin away!

Then load your drawing app’s URL (e.g. rakugaki_pao) —
and now you can tilt, flip, and explore your artwork from new angles.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This lightweight web app wraps a target site inside an <iframe> and applies CSS transform: rotate()
to the container, letting you visually rotate the entire page in real time.
No browser extensions or developer tools required.
